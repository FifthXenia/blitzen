Auditory time blocking.

Just listen to the voices that appear in your head, as they'll tell you what you need to do.

** How to use:
- Timeblock your schedule out, such as:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
;; schizophrenia-timeblock (timeblockName time)
(schizophrenia-timeblock "wake up, this is espeak speaking" "04:00")
(schizophrenia-timeblock "do your work. you know, the thing." "05:00")
(schizophrenia-timeblock "Go jog." "07:00")
(schizophrenia-timeblock "do your work. you know, the thing." "08:00")
(schizophrenia-timeblock "go to sleep, this is espeak speaking" "20:00")
#+end_src
- For each timeblock entry, you'll hear a bell chime, and your timeblock's name spoken, at the given time you inputted for it.
  - (If the time entered is less than the current time, the timeblock will be ignored.)

** Installation instructions via [[https://github.com/radian-software/straight.el][straight.el]]

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package schizophrenia
  :straight (:host github :repo "FifthXenia/schizophrenia"))
#+end_src
- If you're not using straight, you will most likely have to manually set the path for the ~schizophrenia-start-sound~, as it's currently set to a straight-dependent path: ~../../repos/schizophrenia/sounds/org.gnome.Solanum-beep.ogg~
** Dependencies
- ~espeak~: To have the timeblock-you-are-entering's task name spoken to you.
- ~mplayer~: For playing the chime/bell.
