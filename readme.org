Auditory time blocking [[https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/39266/what-is-the-difference-between-daemon-and-demon-in-a-religious-context][daemon]].
- (Will later be augmented to support Interval Tracking).

Pay heed to the shepherd, for they know the lay of the land.

** How to use:
- Timeblock your schedule, such as:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
;; shepherd-flock (timeblockName time)
(shepherd-flock "wake up, this is espeak speaking" "04:00")
(shepherd-flock "do your work. you know, the thing. that thing." "05:00")
(shepherd-flock "Go jog." "07:00")
(shepherd-flock "do your work. you know, the thing. that thing." "08:00")
(shepherd-flock "go to sleep, this is espeak speaking" "20:00")
#+end_src
- For each timeblock entry, you'll hear a bell chime, and your timeblock's name spoken, at the given time you inputted for it.
  - (If the time entered is less than the current time, the timeblock will be ignored.)

*** Example Audio:

** Installation instructions via [[https://github.com/radian-software/straight.el][straight.el]]

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package shepherd
  :straight (:host github :repo "FifthXenia/shepherd"))
#+end_src
- If you're not using straight, you will most likely have to manually set the path for the ~shepherd-start-sound~, as it's currently set to a straight-dependent path: ~../../repos/shepherd/sounds/org.gnome.Solanum-beep.ogg~
** Dependencies
- ~espeak~: To have the timeblock-you-are-entering's task name spoken to you.
- ~mplayer~: For playing the chime/bell.

- This appears to have some overlap in the ideas that I'm doing here (outside of the obvious https://github.com/ichernyshovvv/org-timeblock).


* TO-DO
- 1: Get timeblocks off of org-agenda for the day, stop typing that in manually, it's ridiculous.
- 2: Implement interval tracking
- 3: Allow rescheduling of tasks/interval/agenda via a hydra menu.
- 4: Publish actual schedule interval. Ability to show diff.
- 5: Stats on tasks (time to complete, streak, etc).
